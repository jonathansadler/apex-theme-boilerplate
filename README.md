# APEX Theme Boilerplate
For more info: http://vmorneau.me/apex-theme-boilerplate/

The application export is included in this repo, as well as the theme export.

## What is this Boilerplate thing?
It's an empty APEX 5 application with basic stuff that any APEX theme needs. No pages or anything, just a few shared components templates and settings turned on.

## Do I need this?
You probably don't. Building a theme from the ground up is not something you do everyday. I personally find this useful. Might as well share it, right?

## Install

#### Application
- Import the APEX application ```f14963.sql``` into your workspace.
