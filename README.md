The application export is included in this repo, as well as the theme export.

## What is this Boilerplate thing?
It's an empty APEX application with basic stuff that any APEX theme needs. No pages or anything, just a few shared components templates and settings turned on.

## Install

#### Application
- Import the APEX application ```f14963.sql``` into your workspace.

#### Theme Only
- Import the APEX theme ```f14963_theme_600.sql``` into your existing application.
